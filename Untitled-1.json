MC4R is primarily concerned with the control of appetite and energy expenditure while MC3R is more closely related to the control of linear growth and the timing of puberty. The role of MC3R in the long-term control of energy balance and body composition is less clear, particularly in humans. We have undertaken studies in humans, domestic dogs and mice with the goal of clarifying the relative impact of MC3R deficiency on energy balance, growth and sexual development. By studying three large consanguineously enriched cohorts, totalling approximately 300K people, we identified nine individuals who are homozygous for functionally null MC3R variants. The body mass index (BMI) of the homozygous MC3R variant carriers was not significantly different from that of age, sex and demographically matched controls, with six of the nine homozygotes having a BMI < 30kg/m2. We detected a canine MC3R missense variant (p.M320I) which is common in labrador retrievers and showed that this significantly impairs receptor signalling. Dogs homozygous for p.M320I were lighter and showed delayed pubertal development but were not significantly more obese than wild-type or heterozygous dogs. We also established that the lack of Mc3r delayed pubertal development in both male and female mice. Finally, we studied growth and pubertal trajectories of individuals carrying rare loss-of-function MC3R variants and found that male carriers had delayed peak weight velocity and genital development but had no evidence for excess body fat compared to non-carriers. Our results support MC3R having a conserved role across mammals in controlling growth and pubertal timing. While MC3R deficiency may influence linear growth and body composition, complete loss of MC3R does not result in a penetrant human obesity syndrome.",

Differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNA) associated with melanogenesis were first screened by transcriptome sequencing of mouth skin and skin from 130-day-old Liancheng white ducks. The interaction between novel miR-290 and the PI3K 3'UTR was verified by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Primary duck melanocytes were then isolated from the mouth skin tissue, and the function of miR-290 was examined at the cellular level. The results revealed that novel miR-290 directly targeted PI3K, and the levels of p-PI3K and p-AKT were significantly decreased in the mouth skin compared with skin (P < 0.05), whereas p-GSK3β, Integrin-linked kinase (ILK), Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), tyrosinase (TYR), and Melanocortin 1 Receptor (MC1R) were significantly increased in the mouth skin(P < 0.05). The isolated melanocytes were spindle-shaped and positive for DOPA and melanocytic markers.Overexpression of miR-290 significantly promoted melanocyte proliferation and melanin production (P < 0.01);(RT-qPCR) and Western blot analysis revealed that miR-290 inhibited the expression of PI3K and protein kinase B (AKT) (P < 0.05) and increased the expression of ILK, Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3β (GSK3β), MC1R, MITF, TYR, tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), and tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TYRP2) (P < 0.05). In conclusion, this study identifies a novel duck miR-290 as a positive regulator of melanogenesis, which promotes melanocyte proliferation and melanin synthesis in Liancheng white ducks by suppressing PI3K/AKT signaling and activating downstream melanogenic genes.",

However, their regulatory behavior in human gastric tissue and association with postoperative weight loss following metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) remain unclear.In this prospective case-control study, gastric tissue from 50 patients with obesity undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and 48 non-obese controls was analyzed for FTO and MC4R mRNA expression using quantitative PCR. Adjusted Inverse propensity score weighting (IPSW-adjusted) and age-/sex-adjusted linear regression were applied. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate discriminatory thresholds. Correlation with 12-month percent total weight loss (%TWL) was assessed.FTO expression was significantly upregulated (mean fold-change: 4.68, p < 0.001) and MC4R downregulated (mean fold-change: - 0.91, p < 0.001) in patients with obesity. ROC analysis identified thresholds of > 1.515 for FTO (AUC = 1.00) and < 0.525 for MC4R (AUC = 1.00), both with high sensitivity and specificity. No significant correlation was observed between gene expression and %TWL at 12-month follow-up.Gastric expression of FTO and MC4R accurately discriminates between individuals with and without obesity but does not predict postoperative weight loss outcomes after sleeve gastrectomy. These findings indicate diagnostic potential, whereas prognostic value remains unsubstantial.",

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate discriminatory thresholds. Correlation with 12-month percent total weight loss (%TWL) was assessed.FTO expression was significantly upregulated (mean fold-change: 4.68, p < 0.001) and MC4R downregulated (mean fold-change: - 0.91, p < 0.001) in patients with obesity. ROC analysis identified thresholds of > 1.515 for FTO (AUC = 1.00) and < 0.525 for MC4R (AUC = 1.00), both with high sensitivity and specificity. No significant correlation was observed between gene expression and %TWL at 12-month follow-up.Gastric expression of FTO and MC4R accurately discriminates between individuals with and without obesity but does not predict postoperative weight loss outcomes after sleeve gastrectomy. These findings indicate diagnostic potential, whereas prognostic value remains unsubstantial."
